# CUDA_PlanarConvexHull
Final project for the course [GPU Architecures and Computing](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/courseDetails.xhtml?courseNr=182731&semester=2023S&dswid=7054&dsrid=445) @ TU Wien. <br>

## Convex hull
Given a set of points P in RÂ², compute the smallest subset V of P that spans the convex hull of P, i.e., the convex combination of points in V yields the smallest convex set that contains all points in P.

## Goal of the project
Implement the [quickhull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickhull) algorithm using the software acceleration given by the CUDA SDK.

## Description

random_point.h is the header where number of points and range are specified, as well as the point structure.\
\
\
points_generator.cpp has a function that returns a vector of points of size defined in the .h file.\
serial_quickhull.cpp implements the sequential version of the quickhull algorithm.\
\
\
cuda_quickhull.cu is a first version of the QuickHull implemented with CUDA.\
unified_quickhull.cu implements the same algorithm but using Unified Memory instead.\
pinned_quickhull.cu implements the same algorithm but using Pinned Memory instead.\
zero_quickhull.cu implements the same algorithm but using Zero-Copy Memory instead.\
thrust_quickhull.cu implements quickhull algorithm using advantages of Thrust library.
