# CUDA_PlanarConvexHull
Final project for the "GPU Architecures and Computing" @ TU Wien. <br>
Given a set of points P in RÂ², compute the smallest subset V of P that spans the convex hull of P, i.e., the convex combination of points in V yields the smallest convex set that contains all points in P.
